In this assignment I have created a new Shiny App using Home Health Service (HHS) patient data. The app itself is built on a Markov Model, and the goal is to enable decision makers to simulate the budgetary impact of new HHS interventions. For more information on Markov Models, I would recommend this book: https://www.amazon.ca/Decision-Modelling-Health-Economic-Evaluation/dp/0198526628/ref=asc_df_0198526628/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=295974918954&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11141921357454745376&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9001580&hvtargid=pla-508034963447&psc=1

The app includes the following features:

- GGplot
- Shiny Fluid Rows
- A table of outputs

I have also put the app into a webpage using iframe. For more information on iframes, you can visit this website:
